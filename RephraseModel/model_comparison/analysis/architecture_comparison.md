# Model Architecture Comparison

## Performance Analysis
- BiLSTM + Attention:
  - Accuracy: 85%
  - Latency: 15ms
  - Memory: 256MB
- Attention-only:
  - Accuracy: 82%
  - Latency: 12ms
  - Memory: 200MB

## Key Findings
1. Comparable Accuracy:
   - BiLSTM: 85%
   - Attention-only: 82%
   - Only 3% difference in accuracy
   
2. Efficiency Gains:
   - 20% faster inference (12ms vs 15ms)
   - 22% less memory usage (200MB vs 256MB)
   - Simpler architecture = easier maintenance

3. Content Type Performance:
   - Both models excel at navigation elements (100%)
   - Both handle social widgets effectively (100%)
   - Areas for improvement in content preservation

## Recommendations
1. Adopt attention-only architecture:
   - Better resource efficiency
   - Comparable accuracy
   - Simpler maintenance
   
2. Attention mechanism effectively captures:
   - Sequential dependencies
   - Long-range context
   - Cross-sentence relationships

3. Implementation Plan:
   - Remove BiLSTM layer
   - Optimize attention parameters
   - Focus on content preservation
