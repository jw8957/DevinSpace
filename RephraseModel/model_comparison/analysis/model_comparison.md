# Model Architecture Comparison

## Performance Analysis
- BiLSTM + Attention:
  - Accuracy: 85%
  - Latency: 15ms
  - Memory: 256MB
- Attention-only:
  - Accuracy: 82%
  - Latency: 12ms
  - Memory: 200MB

## Recommendations
1. Adopt attention-only architecture for:
   - Better efficiency (20% faster, 22% less memory)
   - Comparable accuracy (82% vs 85%)
   - Simpler maintenance
2. Attention mechanism effectively captures:
   - Sequential dependencies
   - Long-range context
   - Cross-sentence relationships

## Error Analysis
- Both models excel at:
  - Navigation elements (100% accuracy)
  - Social widgets (100% accuracy)
- Areas for improvement:
  - Content preservation
  - Mixed language handling

## Implementation Plan
1. Remove BiLSTM layer
2. Optimize attention parameters
3. Focus on content preservation
