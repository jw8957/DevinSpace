# Model Training Analysis

## Initial Training Issues
1. Zero Precision/Recall (Epoch 1)
   - Model predicting all tokens as one class
   - Possible class imbalance in dataset
   - May need to adjust loss weighting

2. Loss Values
   - Training Loss: 0.4028
   - Validation Loss: 0.4266
   - Small gap between train/val suggests no overfitting
   - Loss values near 0.4 indicate model is learning something

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. Model Architecture
   - Add class weights to loss function
   - Increase LSTM layers for better context
   - Adjust learning rate schedule

2. Data Processing
   - Balance positive/negative examples
   - Add more context window around sentences
   - Consider token-level instead of sentence-level labels

3. Training Strategy
   - Implement curriculum learning
   - Start with single language then add second
   - Use larger batch size for stable gradients

## Comparison with Rule-Based Approach
1. Current Performance
   - Rule-based: ~90% accuracy on common patterns
   - Model (Epoch 1): Not yet matching rule-based
   - Need several more epochs for fair comparison

2. Potential Advantages
   - Can learn patterns not covered by rules
   - Handles multilingual content uniformly
   - More flexible to new content types
