# Architecture Research Notes

## Key Findings

1. Transformer Efficiency (arXiv:2104.05704)
- Transformers effective even with small datasets
- Compact architectures can achieve high performance
- Attention mechanisms sufficient for many tasks

2. Transformer to RNN Conversion (arXiv:2103.13076)
- Linear-complexity recurrent variants possible
- Trade-off between efficiency and accuracy
- Suggests potential for simplified architectures

3. Length Generalization (arXiv:2207.04901)
- Transformer models can handle varying sequence lengths
- Additional techniques may improve performance
- Architecture choice impacts generalization

4. BERT Analysis (arXiv:1908.08593)
- Self-attention patterns are key to performance
- Some attention heads may be redundant
- Disabling certain attention heads can improve results

5. Embedding Concatenation (arXiv:2010.05006)
- Different types of embeddings can be combined effectively
- Task-specific architecture selection important
- Performance depends on data characteristics

## Architecture Trade-offs

1. Computational Complexity
- BiLSTM: O(n) complexity
- Attention: O(nÂ²) complexity
- Potential for optimized attention variants

2. Memory Usage
- BiLSTM: Fixed memory footprint
- Attention: Grows with sequence length
- Need to consider deployment constraints

3. Performance Considerations
- BiLSTM provides sequential context
- Attention captures long-range dependencies
- Need to evaluate task-specific requirements

## Recommendations for Experimentation
1. Compare architectures:
   - Current: BiLSTM + Attention
   - Simplified: Attention-only
   
2. Evaluation metrics:
   - Accuracy on content filtering
   - Inference latency
   - Memory usage
   - Training time

3. Implementation approach:
   - Keep base transformer model
   - Test with and without BiLSTM layer
   - Measure performance differences
